## DEV env id dockerized, docker compose orchestration

## PROD env is AWS

## ALL dev should be able to be done like this:

1. I comment out the service in docker compose 

2. I build using docker compose so all services are running dockerized except the one I'm working on

3. I spin up the service I'm developing on, on its own like "node server.js", for example
